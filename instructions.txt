FIRST STEPS 

Webpack + TS without any other libs (React, Angular etc.)

0) have node, typescript (npm i -g typescript)

1) setup stuff for version conrtol
-> make a local folder
-> gitHub: new Repo (wiht nothing added, same name as local folder)
-> Terminal: git init
-> Terminal: git add .
-> Terminal: git commit -m "First commit"
-> Terminal: git remote add origin remote repository URL
-> Terminal: git remote -v
-> Terminal: git branch -M master
-> Terminal: git push -u origin master

2) init and change tsconfig
-> Terminal: tsc --init
-> in tsconfig: "target": "es6", "module": "es2015"

3) init package.json to track dependencies
-> Terminal: npm init (then click through)

4) get Webpack, Webpack CLI, TS-Loader
-> Terminal: npm i webpack webpack-cli ts-loader -D
( -D === save to Dev Dependencies)

5) also install TS locally (though already globally installed) to make it work better with Webpack
-> Terminal:  npm i typescript -D

6) create folder structure: ./src/index.ts and ./public/index.html (or dist)

7) create and configure ./webpack.config.js (using the node module system) 

8) add code to index.ts 
-> add '"build": "webpack",' to 'scripts' in package.json 
-> Terminal: npm run build

9) webpack dev server package (-> live reload local dev server) 
-> Terminal: npm i webpack-dev-server -D
-> package.json: add '"serve": "webpack-dev-server",' to the scripts'
-> Terminal: npm run serve

10) Server recompiles, but doesn't rebundle:
-> in ./webpack.config.js add to output: 'publicPath: 'public','

11) to resolve imports without extensions, add:
-> webpack-config.js: resolve: {extensions: ['.ts', '.js']},

12) to get to the TS instead of the js bundle, when watching in Live Server (NOT webpack dev server)
-> tsconfig: "sourceMap": true, 
-> webpack.config: devtool: 'eval-source-map',


!!! whenever the webpack.cofig is changed, the live sver must be stopped and resvered
